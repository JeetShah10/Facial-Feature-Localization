# Facial-Feature-Localization
Facial feature detection is an important and challenging problem in the fields of machine learning and computer vision. The most important 4 applications of facial feature localization are face recognitions, medical purposes, tracking faces in image and videos and at last face filters. In this contribution I introduce a method to do feature localization more accurately. In this project, I have given a list of 96Ã—96-pixel 8-bit gray level images with their corresponding (x, y) coordinates of 15 facial keypoints. I first adopt Sklearn train test split to randomly split the data set into a training set and a test set, so that I can develop our algorithm on the training set and assess its performance on the test set. The baseline model was Convolutional Neural Network and my aim is to outperform the results of it by using Transfer Learning and Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network. Also the project shows one of the applications that is facial filters on the predicted facial key points.
